2007-08-27  Adam Sampson  <ats@offog.org>

	* everything: Put xhippo into Darcs.
	
	* config.c: Rename "bool" to avoid future C99 problems.
	
	* doc/Makefile.am: Use automake to build and install the
	documentation.

	* everything: Update license to GNU GPL version 3.
	
	* configure.in: Changed version to 3.5 -- hopefully this should be
	the last release in the xhippo 3 series.

2007-08-21  Adam Sampson  <ats@offog.org>

	* playlist.c: Remove ID3lib support.

	* callbacks.c: Fix some compiler warnings.

2007-08-21  gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Bump to 0.14.5.

2003-05-16  Adam Sampson  <azz@us-lot.org>

	* everything: Put xhippo into CVS.
	
	* callbacks.c: Lots of changes for how events are handled; fixed
	bugs reported by Matthew Slowe (list position not set correctly if
	you started in mini mode then switched out), and me (if your first
	song choice was a non-initially-visible file, a different song
	would play, due to spurious "changed" events).

2003-02-02  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* config.c: (and others) Added some extra const declarations for
	clean builds with --disable-nls.

	* xhippo.h: Added a MacOS X-specific kludge to always use
	_INTL_REDIRECT_MACROS. Removed the hardcoded ENABLE_NLS, so that
	--disable-nls should now work too.

	* configure.in: Move to libogg-style I18N_CFLAGS etc., so that
	libintl stuff works on systems with no native libintl.

	* xhippo.h: Upgraded gettext (the previous version was broken with
	--with-included-gettext, and it's needed on MacOS X). Changed to
	use gettext.h instead of libintl.h, so that --disable-nls
	works.

	* Makefile.am: Added xhippo.config back to EXTRA_DIST, else it
	doesn't actually get distributed. Oops. Added gettext.h to
	sources.

	* xhippo.config: Add type entry for Speex files. Add example .mp3
	type entry to use madplay (which is free software, and faster than
	mpg123). Change default .wav type entry to use "play" from sox.
	Add type entry for .it. Change default type entries for various
	video formats to use MPlayer instead of xanim (and add a couple of
	new ones). Add an example .ogg entry using MPlayer.

2003-01-31  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am:  Moved xhippo.config into sysconf_DATA, and removed
	config.h from EXTRA_DIST. This means xhippo.config should get
	installed now.

2003-01-30  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Made update_window() only scroll the list if it's
	realized, since if you're starting in mini mode it might not be.

	* callbacks.c: Remove GNOME drag-and-drop parsing, and fix up our
	own to deal with the three different formats for file: URIs
	correctly.

2003-01-29  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: Stop distributing contrib, since it's horribly
	out-of-date.

	* configure.in: Changed to use a config.h file instead of the
	screenful of -Ds it currently generates.

	* callbacks.c: Removed window delete handlers which did nothing.
	Added handle_menu_quit and handle_menu_prefs as proper menu
	callbacks.

	* xhippo.c: Ported to use GtkTreeView instead of GtkCList. The
	code will be much cleaner once the GTK1 stuff is gone, but it's
	still quite a lot larger than it used to be.

	Fixed the bug where with GTK 2.2 clicks on the list don't work --
	handle_menu_popup wasn't declared to return a value. Fixed all the
	other signal handler types too (handle_menu_user only ever worked
	by luck!).

2002-08-27  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Removed gtk_window_set_policy call that caused
	set_mini() not to work with GTK2 (but is required for GTK1).
	Noticed what might be a bug: if you switch to mini mode, then move
	the window, then quit, the new position won't be remembered, since
	handle_configure ignored the configure event. Fixed this. Fixed
	GTK2 bug where window would resize itself to fit the number of
	items in the list by adding gtk_widget_set_size_request call on
	filelist.

	* callbacks.c: Made handle_configure return FALSE (rather than
	being void). The rest of the handle_xxx callbacks probably need
	similar treatment (checking them against the API
	documentation). This makes resizing work with GTK2. Changed the
	window size management functions to the GtkWindow ones for GTK2 as
	well. Mini is still broken.

	* xhippo.c (among others): various changes to get xhippo to work
	with GTK2. I'm keeping GTK1 support for now, since it's quite a
	bit less bloaty and the changes are fairly minimal. Two obvious
	problems noted: the status bar now has an unpleasant Windows-style
	resize triangle (fixed), and filenames which aren't UTF-8 make the
	list complain while rendering. Window resizing is also broken
	(which breaks Mini too). Appears otherwise to work.

2002-08-21  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* playlist.c: Ported to libid3tag (from mad), since id3lib doesn't
	seem to support C properly any more. (The id3lib configure check
	will fail with newer id3lib, so we shouldn't need to remove the
	old code.)

2002-05-27  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added call to set up configuration command list.
	Removed "p" accelerator for config window, since it clashes with
	"Pause". Removed GNOME menus support (since it merely duplicates
	some of the entries in the pop-up menu).

	* config.c: Added dynamic configuration command list (to support
	localisation of prefs dialog).

	* playlist.c: Added missing "All items played" message when
	reaching the end of a playlist in sequential mode.

2001-12-30  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* config.c (among others): Added initial preferences window
	support; currently it only shows the CT_BOOL preferences, and
	(more annoyingly) there's no localisation, since the
	configcommands array isn't built at runtime.

2001-12-27  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* playlist.c: Added playing = 0 to avoid crash when the player has
	already died and we're still playing but a filetype isn't
	recognised, so last_action is NULL when we update the status
	display (reported by Matthew Slowe). This does, however, change
	the old behaviour, since xhippo now stops when it encounters an
	unrecognised filetype rather than continuing; this should probably
	be a config option.

2001-12-11  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* config.c: Added titles for config items.

2001-09-10  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Made the GTK check look for 1.2.0 or
	better. (Reported by Matthew Slowe.)

2001-08-25  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Changed GNOME detection code to use `` rather than
	$(), since Solaris sh doesn't do $(). (Reported by Michael
	Ritzert.)

	* Makefile.am: Removed CFLAGS definition. Added man_MANS so that
	the manpage gets installed. (Reported by Michael Ritzert.)

2001-08-17  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.config: Added a sidplay entry (reported by Eric
	W. Brown).

	* configure.in: Changed version to 3.3.
	
2001-06-27  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* playlist.c: Added mode_persist_frequently. Made persistent
	playlist loading use the cwd as the dirname. Made add_file prepend
	the cwd if the filename is relative (request by Martin Ward).

	* xhippo.c: Moved the gettext setup stuff to before the first time
	it's used.

	* playlist.c: Made nullinput not depend on
	mode_hide_player_output. Completely reworked the child process
	handling: it now uses pipes to synchronise with the child process
	before it execs (since with gcc3 I was finding that if the child
	died immediately the "childpid = fork()" wouldn't yet have
	completed in the parent), and it uses a self-pipe to handle
	SIGCHLD (since once I fixed the first bug it was hanging inside
	GTK---I assume the GTK timeout registration function is thread
	unsafe, unlike the Motif one). Finally got rid of donotstopflag.

2001-06-26  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.config: Added the i option to the ogg type.

	* callbacks.c: Moved the save_window_state call into
	handle_destroy, since it wasn't getting called if you quit from
	the menu (bug reported by Martin Ward).

	* config.c: Removed last_player in favour of last_action. Added
	setgroup and nullinput options to fileaction. Added FUNCTION23
	config type and made add_file_action look for options in its third
	argument (features suggested by Martin Ward).

2001-06-09  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* playlist.c: Changed setpgrp() to setpgid(0, 0) because the
	modern BSD setpgrp takes different arguments, and setpgid is
	POSIX (bug reported by Kevin Lo).

2001-06-06  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added mode_delete_when_played and
	mode_persist_playlist (both suggested by Martin Ward).

	* playlist.c: Factored out delete_row and modified it so it'll
	decrement last_played even if it points to the row we're deleting.
	Factored out write_playlist.
	
	* callbacks.c: Fix a logic bug in handle_menu_delete -- the
	->previous scan was only done when last_played was decremented,
	which was wrong. Made handle_save_ok close the file requester even
	if the playlist couldn't be saved.

	* xhippo.h: Made add_directory be defined even if we don't have
	NFTW (bug reported and patched by Kevin Lo <kevlo@openbsd.org>).

2001-05-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* TODO: Cleaned up (since it hadn't been updated since 1.9;
	reported by Kevin Everets).

	* README: Removed references to sgmltools (reported by Kevin
	Everets).

2001-05-16  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* callbacks.c: Added handle_eventbox_click and made it pop up the
	song info window for the current song when the eventbox is
	left-clicked. Split out popup_songinfo_window.

	* playlist.c: Added a call to setpgrp() in the forked process, and
	made the kill signals go to all processes in the process group;
	this is necessary for some players (patch by Kevin Everets).

	* doc: Merged Kevin Everets' texinfo version of the manual.

	* configure.in: Changed version to 3.2.
	
2001-04-30  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Updated for gettext.

	* po/de.po: Moved German locale out into a .po file.

	* xhippo.c: Split up multiline strings.

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Modified to reformat the documents
	before distribution.

	* po/xhippo.pot: Added gettext support.

	* xhippo.h: Modified to use gettext (patch from Kevin Everets).

2001-04-29  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.h: Added previous to songinfo.

	* callbacks.c: Made handle_menu_delete fix songinfo->previous
	entries.

	* xhippo.c: Added various accelerators (based on patch by Kevin
	Everets). Added Quit to menu (Kevin Everets). Added Prev button.

	* xhippo.config (writeplaying): Added commandlinefiles and
	commandlinedirs.

	* config.c: Added mode_commandline_dirs. Increased default size to
	325x325 (Kevin Everets).

	* playlist.c: Added support for adding directories recursively
	(suggestion by Martin Ward). Abstracted out get_action. Changed
	the random function to the one suggested by the GNU rand() manual
	page. Added pick_prev.

2001-04-16  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* playlist.c: Added id3lib support.

	* Makefile.am (xhippo_LDADD): Added ID3LIBS.

	* xhippo.h: Added id3.h include.

	* configure.in: Added test for libid3.

2001-04-12  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.config: Updated for new option types.

	* config.c: Added support for sorttypes in the config file. Made
	mode_sort_on_load into a sorttype. Added support for boolean
	values.

	* playlist.c: Added sorting by swapped name. Added support for
	sorting automatically by things other than name.

2001-04-07  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* callbacks.c: Fixed title on Add Song dialog (bug reported by
	David Dorward).

2001-03-28  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* callbacks.c: Made handle_menu_delete() either stop playing or
	adjust the current song number (bug reported by Giles Radford).

	* playlist.c: Made clear_playlist() stop playing.

2001-03-27  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* callbacks.c: Made handle_list_click more general and renamed it
	to handle_menu_popup.

	* config.c: Added mode_commandline_songs (at the request of
	Matthew Slowe).

	* xhippo.c: Made clicks on the status bar invoke the context menu
	handler (at the request of David Dorward); this entailed adding an
	event box for the status bar. Added mode_commandline_songs.

	* configure.in: Changed version to 3.1.

2001-03-25  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* config.c: Made the default width and height 300, so that if you
	start xhippo up for the first time with a massive playlist it
	won't size the window to fit it (bug reported by David Dorward).

	* callbacks.c: Fixed handle_menu_user so it doesn't segfault if
	nothing's selected. (I considered making xhippo disable user menu
	items if nothing's selected, but that removes their usefulness for
	starting external programs...)

	* xhippo.h: Moved lots of stuff into xhippo.h and added
	prototypes.

	* xhippo.c: Added -Wmissing-prototypes -Wstrict-prototypes to
	Makefile.am to stop me forgetting prototypes in the future. Moved
	lots of stuff out to other files. Fixed the type of
	handle_sigchld.  Made main automatically assign accelerators to
	user commands (starting from 1, so they fit sensibly on to the
	keyboard).

	* xhippo.c: Made set_mini preserve the width of the window when
	going into mini mode. Celebrated the change to BST. Made set_mini
	call gtk_adjustment_changed so that the list scrolls correctly if
	the adjustment changes while it's hidden.

2001-03-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Moved the status-bar update and list-scrolling code
	out into update_window(), so that it can be updated when we flip
	in and out of mini mode and when we unpause a song it will show
	the player again, and thus removed STRRESUMEPLAY (this being
	loosely at the request of Matthew Slowe). Cleaned up the code in
	start_playing that generates the arguments. Made scroll_catchup
	ensure that the row is completely visible.

2001-03-23  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Changed version to 3.0.

	* xhippo.c: Replace the file type arrays with a linked list of
	struct _fileactions. Replaced STRBUFSIZE - 1 with STRBUFSIZE (and
	similar) in fgets and snprintf calls. Made the config file reader
	table-driven. Renamed a number of functions to have more
	underscores in their names. Removed the horrid evil ugly
	"Obfuscation Junkie" code in favour of strchr while moving the
	"execute configuration command" code out to a separate
	function. Removed strbuf. Added user menu items (at the request of
	Giles Radford). Removed pointless check for fileness in
	read_playlist. Changed wait(NULL) in handle_sigchld to waitpid
	with WNOHANG specified, so we don't deadlock waiting if no child
	has exited (this avoids the occasional deadlock when players die
	immediately). Replaced a few deeply-nested ifs with
	returns. Abstracted out the arguments list string into a variable
	(so we don't have three copies of it, oops). Implemented
	mode_skip_path (patch provided by Jeff Weisberg). Fixed the GNOME
	About dialog's copyright statement.

	* xhippo.h: Ripped out MAXFILETYPES.

	* xhippo.config: Added an example usercommand.

2001-02-11  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added accelerators s, r, n, and p (requested by
	Matthew Slowe).

2000-12-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Made sortplaylist take a function argument and added
	sort_compare_mtime. Added a menu entry for "sort by mtime".

	* xhippo.c: Added read_song_info and sinfo->inforead to guarantee
	that we always have the songinfo fields that come from stat even
	if mode_no_check_files is on. Made sortplaylist and
	handle_menu_info read the information if required.

2000-12-14  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Updated copyright notice to match GNU standards.

2000-12-11  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Changed version number to 2.9.
	
	* xhippo.c: Reworked signal-handling stuff to make it more
	understandable and to remove race conditions when a signal arrives
	in the middle of a GTK operation.

2000-11-30  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added an option to write the display_name of the
	currently-playing song to ~/.xhippo/current_song (suggested by Ben
	Clay Charlton).

	* xhippo.c: Added an option to not bother stat()ing all the files
	in the playlist; this speeds up startup at the cost of
	robustness.

	* xhippo.c: Added support for setting the window title based on
	the name of the playlist (suggested by <zork@lordzork.com>).

	* xhippo.c: Changed exit(20) to _exit(20) if execvp fails.

	* xhippo.c: Added --help for "ordered".

	* xhippo.c (SCANS): Tidied up SCANS to make it readable.

2000-11-25  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Made Mini mode use the display_name rather than the
	basename of the song in the status bar when playing.

2000-11-20  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.h (STRSETHOME): Merged in Markus's updated German locale,
	on the grounds that Kevin Everets said that he's got some more
	patches to come in his Advogato diary today.

2000-09-16  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Changed version to 2.8.

	* xhippo.c: Merged Ken Arromdee's onetime patch.

2000-09-07  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added size and mtime to the songinfo structure.
	Added info window support.

2000-09-05  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Fixed GNOME support. (Reported by Jason Buberel,
	jason@buberel.org.)

	* xhippo.c: Made the config file reader make two passes through
	the file, so that it can be read both before and after the GUI is
	shown. This makes exec/load/exec work again. (Reported by Pierre
	Ganty.)

	* xhippo.c: Added a check for too many filetypes in the config
	file reader.

	* xhippo.c: A number of changes from and inspired by Kevin
	Everets: added name demangling, fixed relative path handling in
	playlists, set last_played to -1 in clearplaylist(), added
	accelerator keys for the popup menu.

	* configure.in: Changed version to 2.7.

2000-08-14  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Made last_played start at -1, and made start_playing
	check that it's valid. This stops a crash when Restart is hit with
	an empty playlist, and also means that hitting Next when you
	haven't yet played anything will play the first song rather than
	the second. (Reported by Kevin Everets.)

	* xhippo.c: Renamed make_button to add_button, and made
	add_menu_item return the item it added.

	* xhippo.c: Changed the logic in handle_list_click so that the
	menu will be shown even if the click isn't over a valid item, and
	the items in the menu will be disabled. That way, you can add
	items to an empty playlist, and you can't select options that
	require an item when you don't have any. (Reported by Kevin Everets.)
	
	* xhippo.c: Got rid of the explicit clearing of the settings in
	main in favour of initialisers.

	* xhippo.c: Added a get_playlist_dir function that finds an
	appropriate playlist directory, checking the playlistdir config
	file option first. (Requested by Kevin Everets.)

	* xhippo.c: Added a check in main.c that the user has set $HOME.

	* contrib: Removed README~. Oops.

	* doc/screenshot.jpeg: Took a new screenshot.
	
	* configure.in: Buffer Overflow Day. Added a check for snprintf,
	and an emulation macro at the top of xhippo.c if we don't have
	it. Turned all sprintf calls into snprintf calls.

	* configure.in: Changed the version number to 2.6.

2000-08-12  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Moved all playlist manipulation commands on to the
	popup menu. Added "Clear Playlist".

	* xhippo.c: Fixed playlist reading again (this time it was reading
	the last entry twice, which sort of makes up for the previous
	version where it didn't read the last line at all!). It's even
	tidier now.

	* xhippo.c: Added a non-GNOME drop handler (you can now drop URIs
	from xftree into xhippo without needing GNOME installed).

	* xhippo.c: Implemented sorting (using qsort). Implemented
	playlist saving. Added -O to make xhippo sort the playlist once
	it's loaded.
	
2000-08-11  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Moved the code to clear the playlist out into a
	seperate function. Moved the code to create buttons out into a new
	function. Added the code to create and display the popup
	menu. (I'm _not_ looking forward to documenting this.) Renamed a
	few functions to have more sensible names.

	* xhippo.c: Implemented move up, move down and delete on the popup
	menu.

	* xhippo.c: Added mode_hide_player_output based on Kevin Everets'
	implementation.

	* configure.in: Changed the version number to 2.5.
	
2000-07-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Removed randomtab and the second column in the list in
	favour of a songinfo structure which is allocated for each
	row. This can hold more information, and has the advantage that we
	can declare a destructor for it, meaning that we can more easily
	keep track of how many items are in the list.

	* xhippo.c: Made mode_scroll_catchup work again (somehow I doubt
	anybody runs with it turned off any more...).

	* xhippo.c: Applied patch from Kevin Everets to add a "leftscroll"
	option to place the scrollbar on the left side of the
	window. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a way of finding
	out from the theme which side the scrollbar should go...

	* xhippo.c: Removed the memory leak in my implementation of
	strcasecmp. (Ahem, not sure how I missed that one originally...)

	* xhippo.c: Made start_playing explicitly set paused = 0.

	* xhippo.c: Moved the code back out of create_list_widget, as it
	only gets called once.

	* xhippo.c: Fixed the bug I introduced with the read_playlist
	cleanup which meant that the last file in the playlist was never
	read.

2000-07-23  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Fixed the case where hitting OK in the file requester
	with no file selected would cause a crash. (The name of the
	directory was getting passed to readplaylist; it now checks the
	file type.)

	* configure.in: Changed the version number to 2.4.

2000-07-22  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.config: Updated the config file to include stripextension
	and to correct the comment for startmini.

	* xhippo.c: Replaced the scrollbox widget with a seperate
	scrollbar and adjustment for the list view; this makes large
	playlists work correctly, and makes the scrolling more accurate.
	The example in the GTK tutorial uses a scrolled window, but this
	method works much better.

	* xhippo.c: Added mode_strip_extension.

	* xhippo.c: Stripped out all the sizeof(gchar)
	references. sizeof(gchar) is always 1; that's the point! (Things
	are going to need to change considerably if xhippo ever gets
	unicode support.)

	* xhippo.c: Just clear the list when loading a new playlist,
	rather than destroying the widget and recreating it (it used to do
	this because it wasn't possible with the old list widget).

	* xhippo.c: Freeze the list when adding items to it.

	* xhippo.c: Stopped the list from scrolling when the selected item
	is already visible.

	* configure.in: Changed VERSION to 2.3.

	* xhippo.c: Made the Mini checkbox get set correctly when the
	window was saved in the mini state; bug reported and patched by
	Kevin Everets.

	* xhippo.c: Tidied up the while() loop when reading a playlist
	(duplicate check for feof()).

2000-07-18  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added pause functions, implemented by Kevin Everets
 	<kevin.everets@alcatel.com>.

	* xhippo.c: Turned Mini into a checkbox.

	* xhippo.c: Localised Random.

	* xhippo.c: Made extension comparison
 	case-insensitive. Implemented an strcasecmp for systems that don't
 	have it and modified configure.in accordingly. Modified
	xhippo.config to remove duplicate type entries.

	* Makefile.am: Stopped shipping the formatted versions of the
	documentation.

2000-03-08  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.config (ordered): Added "ordered" to the config file.

	* configure.in (VERSION): Changed to 2.2.

	* xhippo.c: Wow, it's been a long time since I worked on this. I
	wasn't expecting to do any more work on this version, but I got a
	request from "TSC" yesterday who wanted a non-random mode, and as
	using a CList makes this rather easy, it's in there.

1999-11-19  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Fixed the code in add_file to cope correctly with
	non-absolute pathnames. Changed version to 2.1. Moved the line
	that sets a flag in the randomtab[] array to handle_listclick, so
	that if you explicitly pick a song the randomiser won't pick it
	again until it's exhausted the list (another CList
	advantage!). Note to self: there's an extended ID3 format floating
	around; the ID3 code should probably handle this. It should
	probably also gracefully handle non-MP3 files.

1999-11-02  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Changed version to 2.0. A while ago I forked this
	version to experiment with using a CList rather than a List; I
	think this will be the way to go in the future, so I'm sticking
	with it. The scrolled window now always has the side scrollbar
	and never the bottom one; this was HiP's behaviour, and I rather
	liked it. It occurred to me that I hadn't done much development on
	xhippo since it became a GNU project, so I figured that it was
	time to spend some time on the improved version and tidy it up a
	little. Reenabled scroll_catchup that I'd commented out; it now
	works but gets positioning slightly wrong. Made the load requester
	OK handler scroll the list back up to the top. Added -Wall to the
	compilation options to find compiler warnings (and removed
	them). Noticed that ID3 tag reading is horribly broken, reading
	(apparently) 4 more characters than it should; fixed, although I
	don't have the ID3 spec to fix it properly.  Added HiP-esque
	keyboard accelerators for Stop and Random. (I've bound both KP*
	and KP- to Random because on the Amiga keyboard the star is in the
	top right corner. I have no idea what HiP's accelerator for Stop
	was, so I've bound / to it.) Fixed the Restart button (adding
	last_played along the way). Also, I have no idea what I did, but
	it fixed the resizing problem, so that's good. Checked the look of
	the interface with several GTK themes... it's looking good!
	(Particularly with XFCE.)

1999-08-05  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* xhippo.c: Added a configure option to turn the GNOME menubar on
	and off.

	* configure.in (VERSION): Upped to 1.2.
	(AC_ARG_WITH): Fixed spacing in configure --help.

	* xhippo.c: Added code to store the size of the window as well as
	the position (as I'm now using a bigger display).

1999-08-01  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in (VERSION): Upped to 1.1 and uploaded.

	* xhippo.c: Added Rod Taylor's patch (#ifndef NOGETOPTLONG), which
	is meant to fix compilation on BSD systems.

1999-07-03  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Altered check for getopt_long to set a variable if
	not found (rather than dying), and added a check for getopt (on
	the grounds that if you don't have getopt, you can't possibly have
	getopt_long!).
	(VERSION): Bumped version to 1.05 and uploaded.

	* xhippo.c: Added code to cope with systems that don't have
	getopt_long (like FreeBSD).

1999-07-02  Adam Sampson  <azz@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): Changed datadir to sysconfdir, as
	recommended by Rod Taylor (who also maintains the FreeBSD port).

1999-06-13  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.config (type): Added capital versions of the mod types.

1999-06-12  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am (dist-hook): Added rules to copy the doc/ directory.

	* xhippo.c: Added a GNOME menu item for Mini. Added getopt support
	and updated the help description for long options. Updated the
	--version output to fit the GNU standards.

	* xhippo.c: Xhippo is now officially a GNU program!

1999-06-07  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* configure.in (VERSION): Bumped version to 0.95.

	* xhippo.c: Removed my ugly kludge for window resizing and
	replaced it with a gtk_window_set_policy call in the right place,
	as suggested by Trog <trog@gtk.org>.

1999-06-05  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Changed winpos to winstate, and made xhippo save
	whether the window is minified or not.

	* xhippo.config: Added entries for savewinpos and startmini. Also
	added filetypes for "mov" and "avi" files using xanim.

	* xhippo.c: Added mode_start_mini and mode_save_window_pos, along
	with all the trappings and language strings.

	* xhippo.h (STRNOPLAYLIST): Added language strings for Mini.

	* xhippo.c: Added lots of stuff to handle the Mini button. I'm not
	happy with the way resizing the window is handled, though, nor
	with the constant -2 in void status().

	* configure.in (VERSION): Bumped version to 0.9.

1999-05-26  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Removed the GNOME-specific handle_menu_X
	functions. The button-related versions work just as well.

	* README: Added entries for the Load button.

	* configure.in (VERSION): Bumped version to 0.85.

	* xhippo.c: Fixed the gchar-always-one-byte assumption in
	read_mp3_tag.
	Made lots of modifications to allow the Load button. This included
	moving the handle_X functions to after the playlist-loading
	functions; adding a button definition; adding handlers for the new
	button; adding a variable for the file selector; adding handlers
	for the file selector; abstracting the construction of the
	playlist widget out into a function.
	I am not entirely happy with the way this is implemented; it isn't
	very pretty. It may cause a memory leak too---I don't know if GTK
	is clever enough to gtk_widget_destroy all subwidgets of a
	container when the container (the list in this case) is
	destroyed. However, the users get what they want.

1999-03-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Replaced the waitpid() call with a wait(NULL) in the
	SIGCHLD handler (which is what uwm does). This works at least as
	well as the old system and is much simpler. And I can't provoke it
	into producing zombies any more. Also renamed kludgeflag to
	childnotfinished, to make it a little easier to understand, and
	removed the following large and obnoxious comment: "/* This kludge
	seems to improve the "hanging GTK" bug.  * "kludgeflag" is set to
	0 only when the SIGCHLD signal is receieved.  * I think what was
	happening is that the SIGCHLD was trying to start * another child
	which couldn't open the audio device and so died * immediately --
	starting another child. The resulting chain reaction * hung
	xhippo. The donotstopflag variable is also part of this kludge.
	*/"

1999-03-21  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.config (type): Added "MP3" as an extension. D'oh!

1999-03-15  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* configure.in (VERSION): Hiked version to 0.8.

	* xhippo.c: Fixed an off-by-one error when trying to guess the
	file's type; it initialised the "type" pointer one gchar after the
	null, so occasionally (such as when I dropped Summer of '69 onto
	the interface!) it would pick up the string following it in the
	data area ("Gtk") as the name, and hence fail miserably to
	correctly guess the type.
	
1999-03-14  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c (dndDrop): Added GNOME drag-and-drop support.

	* README: Released and announced 0.7.
	
1999-03-13  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* configure.in: Created. Today was autoconf day. Moved everything
	(hopefully) over. I must admit that automake/autoconf makes
	several things that were extremely hacky before work just fine.
	GTK version autodetect added. GNOMification and German support
	were made configure options rather than Makefile options.

	* Makefile.am: Created. Also copied in install-sh.

1999-03-08  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Added GNOME stuff.

	* Makefile: Added GNOME stuff.

1999-03-02  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Made the readid3 option actually work. :)

1999-02-28  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* Makefile (distro): Added xhippo.gtkrc to the list of distro
	files. D'oh!

	* xhippo.gtkrc: Added the font change to the style.

	* Makefile (VERSION): Bumped version to 0.7.

	* README: Added entry for readid3.

	* xhippo.config: Added entry for readid3.

	* xhippo.c: Merged in the changes from Craig Knudsen to read ID3
	tags, and added code to handle the readid3 and -i options.

1999-02-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* Makefile: Added a note about installation into your home
	directory.

	* README: Documented the changes below. Also credited Hubert
	Fehrer for his NetBSD package, and added a comment about automatic
	production of playlists.

	* Makefile: Added automatic version numbering of the tarball; the
	VERSION define is now set in the Makefile. This is much cleaner
	than the way it was done before. Suggested by Hubert Feyrer to
	make NetBSD packaging easier.
	(VERSION): Bumped version to 0.6.

	* xhippo.c: Added playlist inclusion by !filename in a playlist,
	requested by Joseph Turian.

1999-02-23  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* README: Uploaded 0.5, updated the web pages and announced it on
	Freshmeat.
	
1999-02-07  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* README: It ought to be mentioned that I fixed the inconsistent
	spelling of "GTK" throughout this a few days ago, and forget to
	mention it here.

	* xhippo.gtkrc: Made a style for all widgets that darkened the
	background grey to Grey76, in order to match icewm, Netscape and
	most other apps.

	* xhippo.c: Added must_play_all mode, to improve the randomness of
 	the selection from the list.  Added show_pid mode, so that users
	(hi Volker!) can turn off the (pid xxx) display.

1999-02-03  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.h (VERSION_STRING): Bumped version to 0.5 (as I wanted to
	send Volker a copy).

1999-02-01  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Fixed the gtk 1.1 problem. Just did what the error
	message said to do.

1999-01-24  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* Makefile (distro): Made distro create a directory into which the 
	xhippo distribution is put before archiving; this makes it easier
	to unpack.

	* README: Changed titles from "---" to "***". Added references to
	contrib directory.

	* contrib/README: Created. Added Jeff Covey's
	xhippo-chooser.pl. Moved Volker's German docs into this
	directory.

	* README: Various changes to refer to ".xhippo/config" rather than 
	".xhippo.config" etc.

	* xhippo.c: Various changes to enable the use of the ".xhippo"
	directory rather than lots of files in your home directory. This
	was essentially Jeff Covey's idea.

	* gtkrc: Created.

	* xhippo.c: Added "mode_scroll_catchup" to turn the new scroll
	feature on and off, and the "-s" and "scroll" commands.

	For some reason, gtkrc support doesn't work at all. Whether this
	is due to xhippo or the old gtk that I'm using is unknown.

	* xhippo.config (scroll): Added entry for "scroll".

	* xhippo.h (VERSION_STRING): Bumped version to 0.4.

	* xhippo.c: xhippo now scrolls the list to keep up with
	randomly-picked songs. It's not very pretty at the moment, but it
	works.

1999-01-19  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Received bug report from Hubert Feyrer,
	hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de, saying that under Gtk 1.1 the
	scrollbars don't appear, giving an error message saying to use
	"gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport()" rather than
	"gtk_scrolled_window_add()". Given that neither of these exist
	(apparently) under the Gtk that I'm using, I suspect that this is
	a Gtk 1.1 compatability problem.

	Noticed another bug: non-absolute filenames get truncated; not
	sure why yet.

	* Makefile: Received bug report from Hubert Feyrer,
	hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de; I'd forgotten that
	ETCDEST was also in config.h. It now uses one PREFIX variable
	rather than BINDEST and ETCDEST, and defines SYSTEMXHIPPOCONFIG in 
	the Makefile.

1999-01-18  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk

	* README: xhippo 0.3 was announced on Freshmeat today.
	
1999-01-10  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.xpm: Produced this image by screengrabbing the Amiga
 	emulator. This means the colours are slightly wrong. Made
 	transparent by hand.

1999-01-09  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* Makefile: Added xhippo.config to "make install".
	(distro): Added "distro" rule to make a tarball.

	* README: Updated.

	* xhippo.c: Removed a spurious g_print(rcname).
	
	Added config file support. This meant splitting the "read
	playlist" routine into another function.

	* xhippo.h: Split most of the definitions into this file.

	* README.fvwm2: Split fvwm configuration stuff into this file.

	* Makefile: Added the "make install" rule.

	* xhippo.c: Incorporated Volker's German localisation and LIESMICH 
	file.  

	Made the strings read "Playing with ... (pid ...)", to stop
	confusing Volker. :-)

	Added a define for the version. Bumped the version to 0.3.
	
	Removed the STRWINTITLE strings from the localisations. This is
	now always ("xhippo %s", VERSION_STRING).
	
1999-01-04  Adam Sampson  <azz@josstix.demon.co.uk>

	* xhippo.c: Changed "mikmod" to "xmp -f44100". xmp sounds better,
	is freer, uses less CPU time and doesn't use curses. In general,
	it's better for xhippo.

	Added a few lines to read ~/.xhippo.gtkrc, and some names for the
	widgets. Implemented using conventional C strings for now until
	glib's string handling is better documented!
