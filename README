Welcome to GNU xhippo, a generic front-end for sound players.

The xhippo manual can be found in the doc/ subdirectory. By default it
is provided into Texinfo format; to generate other formats, you can use
commands such as `make ps' or `make pdf'.

xhippo 3 is firmly in maintainance mode; I will continue to fix bugs if
anyone finds any, but new users are strongly advised to try out the
rewritten "Potamus" branch which will eventually become xhippo 4:

Please report xhippo bugs to bug-xhippo@gnu.org.
