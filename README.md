# `xhippo`

Welcome to GNU xhippo, a generic front-end for sound players.

The xhippo manual can be found in the doc/ subdirectory. By default it
is provided into Texinfo format; to generate other formats, you can use
commands such as `make ps' or `make pdf'.

This is version 4.0. GNU xhippo now uses ffplay for everything by default
and requires GTK2 to build.
