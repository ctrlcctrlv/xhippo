*** Outstanding

"widget" commands in gtkrc files don't work, at least on my
system. This may be bad documentation on gtk's part, since
"widget_class" commands work fine.

GNOME stuff is not localised.

Localisation should really use gettext rather than my current system.

GNOME checks in configure.in aren't done correctly (but should work
fine anyway).

*** Fixed

Sometimes xhippo leaves zombie player processes, sometimes not. I
still don't understand why. [Fixed]

[From Volker:] "Why is the number of entries in the list increased
every time i klick onto a file?" Actually a misbug; it wasn't obvious
or documented that the number in brackets in the "playing" message was
the PID of the playing process. At least, I assume that's what Volker
meant. Fixed now; it says "filename (pid number)".
