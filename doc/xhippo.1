.SH NAME
xhippo \- A GTK-based playlist manager for various UNIX sound players.
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
xhippo [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIdir\fR | \fIfile\fR ...]
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
GNU `\fBxhippo\fR' is a generic playlist manager program for a variety of
UNIX sound players. It's been shown to work with `\fBmpg123\fR',
`\fBmadplay\fR', `\fBbplay\fR', `\fBs3mod\fR', `\fBtracker\fR', `\fBxmp\fR',
`\fBmtvp\fR', `\fBsplay\fR', `\fBogg123\fR' and `\fBtimidity\fR', and should
work with more-or-less anything that can take a filename on the command
line. It is capable of automatically deciding which player to use
depending on a file's extension; the defaults are set in a config
file. It uses textual playlist files, which are easily generated with
the `\fBfind\fR' or `\fBlocate\fR' utilities. The interface of
`\fBxhippo\fR' is very loosely modelled on the shareware `HippoPlayer'
player for the Amiga.
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' 3 is firmly in maintainance mode; I will continue to fix bugs if
anyone finds any, but new users are strongly advised to try out the
rewritten `Potamus' branch which will eventually become `\fBxhippo\fR' 4,
available from \fIhttp://offog.org/code/potamus.html\fR.
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' was developed under GNU/Linux, but it contains nothing
Linux-specific, so it will probably work on any UNIX-like system where
gcc, glib and GTK are available. (Additionally, it supports GNU long
options where \fIgetopt_long\fR is available.)  If you're using
NetBSD or FreeBSD, a port is available---see See \fBInstallation\fR.
`\fBxhippo\fR' can be compiled as a GNOME 1 application, and it can be
compiled against GTK+ 1.2, 2.0 or 2.2. `\fBxhippo\fR' supports standard
drag-and-drop (which works with the GNOME, KDE and ROX file managers,
and any other supporting the standard protocol).
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' comes with NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of GNU `\fBxhippo\fR' under the terms of the
GNU General Public License. For more information about these matters,
see the file named \fICOPYING\fR.
.PP
If you've installed a previous version of `\fBxhippo\fR', read the
\fIChangeLog\fR for information on what's changed recently.
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' uses GNU gettext for internationalisation; you can pick
the language you want by setting your \fILANG\fR environment variable.
If your C library's gettext support doesn't work, you can give the
\fI--with-included-gettext\fR option to the \fIconfigure\fR script to
make it use the copy of gettext included in the package.
.PP
If you've downloaded `\fBxhippo\fR', please send me some mail to tell me
what you think of it.  Suggestions for improvements will be gratefully
received.
.PP
.SH "INSTALLATION"
Before reading this section, check that your operating system
distribution doesn't already contain a package for `\fBxhippo\fR'. If it
does, then you will probably be best off using that rather than building
it by hand. If it doesn't, or if you want to use a more recent version,
then read on.
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' uses `\fBGTK+\fR', and requires `\fBGTK+ 1.2\fR' or
higher; it needs `\fBgtk-config\fR' in your path in order to build. It uses GNU
`\fBautomake\fR' and `\fBautoconf\fR', so it will automatically detect
some features of your system that can affect `\fBxhippo\fR''s
performance. If you have `\fBlibid3tag\fR' from the `\fBlibmad\fR'
package installed (available along with the `\fBmadplay\fR' MPEG audio
player, which works well with `\fBxhippo\fR', from
\fIhttp://mad.sourceforge.net/\fR), `\fBxhippo\fR' will use it to read
ID3 tags. (If you don't have it installed, `\fBxhippo\fR' will use its
own simple implementation which only understands ID3v1.)
.PP
To compile, change to the source directory and do
.PP
.cc @
./configure
@cc .
.br
make
.br
.PP
If you want (minimal) GNOME 1 support, do \fI./configure
--with-gnome\fR instead of \fI./configure\fR. If you wish to use
`\fBGTK+ 2.0\fR' or higher, do \fI./configure --with-gtk2\fR.  If you
encounter problems finding GTK while building, do \fI./configure
--help\fR to find out how to specify where GTK files are stored.  If you
want to install into a different place, do \fI./configure
--prefix=/usr/local/xhippo\fR or wherever.  Several other options are
available; try \fI./configure --help\fR for more information.
.PP
To install the program, do
.PP
make install
.br
.PP
Each user who wants to use `\fBxhippo\fR' should create a \fI.xhippo\fR
directory in their home directory.  `\fBxhippo\fR' will look for the
\fIconfig\fR and \fIgtkrc\fR files there, and will save its window
state into the \fIwinstate\fR file there if configured to. Playlists
should be kept in a \fI.xhippo/playlists/\fR directory.
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' finds your home directory by looking for the \fIHOME\fR
environment variable. If this is not set by default, you should add a
line of the form 
.PP
export HOME=`pwd`
.br
.PP
or your shell's equivalent to your profile script.
.PP
.SH "INVOCATION"
   To use `\fBxhippo\fR', you need to give it at least one playlist. You can
either load a playlist by specifying it on the command line or in the
config file, or you can build a playlist by dropping files from a file
manager into the `\fBxhippo\fR' window or using the "Add Song" option on the
pop-up menu.
.PP
   Playlists are files containing names of files to play, one per
line.  This is compatible with XMMS's playlist format, so if you have
an XMMS playlist called \fINice\fR, you could do \fIxhippo
$HOME/.x11amp/Nice\fR to use it. (GQmpeg can also import `\fBxhippo\fR'
playlists.)  Alternately, you can generate them with the `\fBfind\fR'
command; for instance, if you keep your .ogg files in your
\fI$HOME/sound\fR directory, you could do
.PP
find $HOME/sound -name *.ogg | sort >$HOME/.xhippo/playlists/ogg
.br
xhippo $HOME/.xhippo/playlists/ogg
.br
.PP
to make a playlist and play it. (With a little trickery, `\fBxhippo\fR' can
be persuaded to automatically build playlists from a directory on
startup; see the example config file for more information.)
.PP
Playlists can also include other playlists by name; to do this, put a
line of the form
.PP
!foo
.br
.PP
in the playlist.  `\fBxhippo\fR' will then try to load the file
\fIfoo\fR as a playlist, inserting its entries into the list at that
point. If the \fI-i\fR command-line option or \fIreadid3\fR
config-file option are enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will try to find ID3 tags
in the listed files and will put them in the list rather than the
filenames if found.
.PP
To start playing automatically once a playlist is loaded, use the
\fI-a\fR option anywhere on the command line (or the \fIautostart\fR
command in the config file).
.PP
You can specify multiple playlists on the command line.  Alternatively,
you can specify the \fI-f\fR option to make `\fBxhippo\fR' treat
command-line arguments as files to be added to the playlist rather than
playlists to load (for instance, \fIxhippo -f *.ogg\fR), or \fI-D\fR
to make `\fBxhippo\fR' treat command-line arguments as directories to be
searched for playable files.
.PP
\fIxhippo -h\fR or \fIxhippo --help\fR will give you some simple help
instructions.
.PP
.SH "GUI"
The status line shows a little information about the player; it shows
the number of playlist entries upon startup, and what player is being
used to play the current song (and the PID of the player process, if you
use \fI-p\fR or \fIshowpid:1\fR in the config file). To start a song,
click on it in the list, or click "Next" to pick either a random song
(see the \fImustplayall\fR config file option below to find out how to
control this), or the next song in the playlist, depending on the
setting of the "Random" checkbox. Clicking on "Prev" will play the
previous song (if the "Random" checkbox is enabled, the last random song
picked). To restart the current song from the beginning, click
"Restart". To stop, click "Stop".
.PP
`\fBxhippo\fR' supports a number of keyboard accelerators: `\fBr\fR' for
Restart, `\fBs\fR' or keypad `\fB/\fR' for Stop, `\fBp\fR' or keypad `\fB+\fR'
for Pause, `\fBn\fR', keypad `\fB*\fR' or keypad `\fB-\fR' for Next, `\fBb\fR'
for Prev, `\fB`\fR' for Mini, `\fBh\fR' for Random, `\fBa\fR' for Add File,
`\fBd\fR' for Add Directory, `\fBl\fR' for Load Playlist, `\fBv\fR' for Save
Playlist, `\fBo\fR' for Sort By Name, `\fBw\fR' for Sort By Swapped Name,
`\fBt\fR' for Sort By Mtime, `\fBc\fR' for Clear Playlist, `\fB0\fR' to
`\fB9\fR' for user-defined menu entries and `\fBq\fR' for quit.
.PP
When the end of a song is reached, `\fBxhippo\fR' will pick either a
random one or the next one from the list depending on whether the
"Random" checkbox is set or not. Optionally, `\fBxhippo\fR' can scroll
the list so that the randomly-picked song is at the top of the visible
section; to enable this, use the \fI-s\fR command-line option, or the
\fIscroll:1\fR config-file option below. To quit, use your window
manager's close button, pick Quit from the pop-up menu or send
`\fBxhippo\fR' a `SIGINT' `\fBCtrl-C\fR'.
.PP
If you check the "Mini" checkbox, the list of files will disappear,
making the window smaller; unchecking it will make it reappear. You
can make `\fBxhippo\fR' start up in this "minified" state by using the
\fI-t\fR switch or the \fIstartmini:1\fR option in your config file.
.PP
You can drop `file:' URLs (such as files from your file manager) onto
the `\fBxhippo\fR' window to add songs to the playlist (if you drop a
directory, it will search the directory for files to add). Other URLs
(such as `http:') are not supported, as there's no simple mechanism that
all players understand to stream a file from a network connection.
.PP
Right-clicking on the playlist or the status bar will bring up a pop-up
menu, which allows you to bring up an information window for a song
showing the song's size, location and the date it was last modified,
move songs up and down within the playlist, remove songs from the
playlist, add songs or directories to the playlist, sort the playlist
by song name, swapped song name (the part after the first \fI-\fR in
the name) or song mtime, load and save playlists, or bring up the
preferences dialog. The default directory for loading and saving
playlists is \fI$HOME/.xhippo/playlists\fR. Left-clicking on the
status bar will bring up the information window for the song that is
currently playing.
.PP
If you use the \fI-w\fR switch or the \fIsavewinstate\fR config file
option, `\fBxhippo\fR' will save its window position and size to your
\fI$HOME/.xhippo/winstate\fR file when you close the window, and will
reload it on startup.
.PP
.SH "CONFIG FILE"
`\fBxhippo\fR' searches for its config file as
\fI/usr/local/etc/xhippo.config\fR (or wherever you specified with the
\fI--prefix\fR option to `\fBconfigure\fR'), \fI$HOME/.xhippo/config\fR
and \fIxhippo.config\fR (in the current directory); all that are
present will be read.
.PP
Most config-file options have a command-line equivalent; these support
both traditional (\fI-x\fR) and GNU-style long (\fI--extended\fR)
options.  The long options have the same name as the config-file
options; \fI--option\fR is equivalent to \fIoption:1\fR in the config
file (i.e. it forces the option on). The command-line options override
the config file. Invoke `\fBxhippo\fR' as \fIxhippo --help\fR for more
information.
.PP
Many config-file options are alterable from within the GUI at runtime
through the Preferences dialog, which can be brought up from the
context menu.
.PP
A config file line starting with a \fI#\fR will be ignored.
.PP
Lines have the format \fIcommand:arg1:arg2...\fR. Arguments can be of
several types: booleans, integers, strings and sort types. Booleans
represent on/off conditions; \fIyes\fR, \fIon\fR, \fItrue\fR or any non-zero
integer will enable the attribute, and any other value will disable it.
For sort types, \fInone\fR (or any other unrecognised value) means don't
sort, \fIname\fR (or, for backwards compatibility, any non-zero numeric
value) means sort by name, \fIswapped\fR means sort by swapped name,
\fImtime\fR means sort by mtime.
.PP
The following configuration commands are accepted:
.PP
`\fBtype:extension:command[:options]\fR'
.RS
When `\fBxhippo\fR' encounters a file whose name ends in
.cc @
\fI.extension\fR, it will use \fIcommand \fIfile\fR\fR to play it. The
@cc .
extension is case-insensitive. \fIoptions\fR is optional and controls
how the player will be started by `\fBxhippo\fR'; if it contains \fIg\fR
then the player will be started in its own process group (necessary to
properly kill some multithreaded players); if it contains \fIi\fR then
the player will be started with stdin connected to
`\fB/dev/null\fR'. Examples: \fItype:mp3:mpg123 -b 1024\fR,
\fItype:ogg:ogg123:i\fR
.PP
About the only requirement that `\fBxhippo\fR' has on the players that
it uses is that they must quit cleanly when sent a `\fBSIGTERM\fR', and
be pauseable with `\fBSIGSTOP\fR' and `\fBSIGCONT\fR'. Some versions of
the multithreaded `\fBogg123\fR' have the problem that, when sent a
`\fBSIGTERM\fR', the main thread exits immediately but the audio device
isn't closed until the buffer is empty (which could be up to a couple
of seconds later). This means that `\fBxhippo\fR' thinks the player has
exited before the audio device is available again. This is merely
annoying if your operating system and hardware permits the audio
device to be opened by multiple processes at once, but if it doesn't,
then when a song finishes xhippo will attempt to start the next and
fail, and do this repeatedly until the audio device is available
again. One solution is to use another Vorbis player instead of
`\fBogg123\fR' (such as the somewhat-more-heavyweight `\fBmplayer\fR').
.PP
.RE
`\fBautostart:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will play a random song on startup. This is
equivalent to \fI-a\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBscroll:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will scroll the list when a random item is
selected so that the selected song is visible. This is equivalent to
\fI-s\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBmustplayall:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will always pick an item that it hasn't played
before from the playlist when asked to pick a random entry. This
continues until it has played all the entries, at which point it will
just pick a random one as before. This is equivalent to \fI-m\fR on the
command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBreadid3:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will try to read ID3 tags from the files
listed in the playlists and will use them as the playlist entries if
found. This slows down `\fBxhippo\fR' startup considerably, so it's
disabled by default. This is equivalent to \fI-i\fR on the command
line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBexec:command\fR'
.RS
\fIcommand\fR will be executed as a shell command (using
\fI/bin/sh\fR) before any further config commands are parsed.  For an
example of why I included this, look at the example config file
(\fIxhippo.config\fR).
.PP
.RE
`\fBload:playlist\fR'
.RS
\fIplaylist\fR will be loaded as a playlist file. This is equivalent to
including \fIplaylist\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBsavewinstate:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will save its window position, size and state
(whether it is minified or not) between sessions in the
\fI$HOME/.xhippo/winstate\fR file. If it is zero, `\fBxhippo\fR' will
allow your window manager to place it, will start with a "standard"
(small) size, and won't start minified (unless the next option is
specified). This is equivalent to \fI-w\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBstartmini:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will start up in the "minified" state, as if
you'd clicked the "Mini" button (even if the winstate file says that the
window wasn't tinified). This is equivalent to \fI-t\fR (for "tiny") on
the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBshowpid:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will show the PID of its player process in the
status line when not in mini mode. This is equivalent to \fI-p\fR on
the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBordered:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will start with the "Random" checkbox turned
off. This is equivalent to \fI-o\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBstripextension:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will strip the extensions from the filenames
displayed in the playlist. This is equivalent to \fI-S\fR on the
command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBleftscroll:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will place the vertical scrollbar on the left
side of the playlist.  This looks better with NeXTStep-like themes. This
is equivalent to \fI-l\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBhideplayeroutput:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will redirect the output (stdout and stderr)
of child player processes to \fI/dev/null\fR. This is equivalent to
\fI-q\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBsortonload:sorttype\fR'
.RS
\fIsorttype\fR specifies how `\fBxhippo\fR' should sort playlists when
they are loaded. \fI-O\fR on the command line is equivalent to
\fIsortonload:name\fR.
.PP
.RE
`\fBplaylistdir:dir\fR'
.RS
Use \fIdir\fR as the default directory for loading or saving playlists.
.PP
.RE
`\fBdemanglenames:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will replace \fI_\fR (underscores) and
\fI%20\fRs in song names with spaces on the display. This is equivalent
to \fI-d\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBonetime:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled and either \fIordered\fR or \fImustplayall\fR are turned
on, `\fBxhippo\fR' will stop when all the items in the playlist have been
played. This is equivalent to \fI-1\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBplaylisttitle:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, then `\fBxhippo\fR' will set the window title to include the
name of the current playlist. This is equivalent to \fI-T\fR on the
command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBtitlebasename:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, then `\fBxhippo\fR' will use the basename of the playlist
name when setting the window title if \fIplaylisttitle\fR is set. This
is equivalent to \fI-b\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBnocheckfiles:boolean\fR'
.RS
Normally, when a playlist is loaded, `\fBxhippo\fR' will check to see
whether all the listed files exist and discard them if they don't.  If
enabled, then `\fBxhippo\fR' won't bother checking, which will make
startup significantly faster on large playlists. This is equivalent to
\fI-c\fR on the command line.  Note that `\fBxhippo\fR' will read the
information if it's needed at a later time, so if you sort the playlist
by mtime then it'll need to scan all the files to get the mtimes.
.PP
.RE
`\fBwriteplaying:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, then `\fBxhippo\fR' will write the name of the song that is
currently playing to \fI$HOME/.xhippo/current_song\fR. (If the file
cannot be written, `\fBxhippo\fR' will silently ignore it.) This is
equivalent to \fI-W\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBskippath:integer\fR'
.RS
Normally when displaying song names in the playlist, `\fBxhippo\fR' will
use the basename of the file (i.e. it will strip off the path to the
file). If \fIinteger\fR is set to something other than zero,
`\fBxhippo\fR' will only strip the first \fIinteger\fR elements of the
path; this could be useful if you sort your music collection into albums
and want to display the album names in the playlist. This is equivalent
to \fI-k \fIinteger\fR\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBusercommand:description:command\fR'
.RS
Define a user command. This will add an entry titled \fIdescription\fR
to the context menu (and assign it a numerical accelerator starting from
`0'); when the entry is picked, \fIcommand\fR will be run (with a single
instance of \fI%s\fR in the command replaced by the full filename of
the selected song, or the empty string if the menu is invoked while not
over a song).
.PP
.RE
`\fBcommandlinesongs:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will treat command-line arguments as songs to
add to the playlist rather than playlists to load. This is equivalent to
\fI-f\fR on the command line; you can therefore do something like
\fIxhippo -f *.ogg\fR to start `\fBxhippo\fR' listing all the `.ogg'
files in the current directory.
.PP
.RE
`\fBcommandlinedirs:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will treat command-line arguments as
directories to search for songs to add to the playlist.  This is
equivalent to \fI-D\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBdeletewhenplayed:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will remove songs from the playlist once they
have been played. This is equivalent to \fI-x\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBpersistplaylist:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will attempt to load a playlist from
\fI$HOME/.xhippo/saved_playlist\fR on startup (if no other files are
given on the command line), and will save the current playlist to that
file on exit. This is equivalent to \fI-P\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBcommandlineguess:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR' will attempt to guess what the command-line
arguments are. If they have a known extension (one specified with
\fItype\fR above) then they are assumed to be songs; if they are
directories they are assumed to be directories; otherwise they are
assumed to be playlists. You probably want this turned on unless you're
in the habit of calling your playlist \fIplaylist.ogg\fR. This is
equivalent to \fI-g\fR on the command line.
.PP
.RE
`\fBpersistfrequently:boolean\fR'
.RS
If enabled and \fIpersistplaylist\fR is also enabled, `\fBxhippo\fR'
will save the current playlist whenever a new song is started. You may
want this if you're in the habit of killing xhippo randomly.

.PP
.SH "GTKRC"
To allow for customised GTK appearances, `\fBxhippo\fR' reads a standard
gtkrc file in \fI$HOME/.xhippo/gtkrc\fR. For more information about gtkrc
files, consult the GTK documentation.
.PP
.SH "DISTRIBUTION"
If you want an archive to give to somebody else, invoke \fImake
dist\fR in the `\fBxhippo\fR' source directory. This will produce the
same \fIxhippo-VERSION.tar.gz\fR file that I distribute. If you wish
to mail me a modified version, do exactly the same (after removing the
\fIdoc\fR directory); I can then `\fBdiff\fR' it against my last
release to see what you've changed. (Alternately, just send me a
\fIdiff -Naur\fR between a clean distributed `\fBxhippo\fR' and your
modified version.)
.PP
.SH "CONTACT"
`\fBxhippo\fR' is far from perfect. Please contact
